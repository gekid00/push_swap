# push_swap 🔀💡
Overview
The push_swap project at 42 focuses on creating an efficient sorting algorithm for two stacks. The goal is to sort a list of integers using a minimal number of operations, specifically push, swap, and rotate operations.

# Key Features 🛠️
- Sorts a list of integers using only two stacks.

- Minimizes the number of operations required to sort the list.

- Implements different sorting algorithms to achieve optimal performance for various scenarios.

# Challenges & Learning 🧠👨‍💻
- Algorithm design: Finding the most efficient algorithm for sorting with limited operations.

- Data structures: Effectively managing stacks and understanding their limitations.

- Optimization: Reducing the number of operations to a minimum using different sorting techniques and algorithms.

# Why This Project? 💡
A great way to improve your understanding of algorithms, data structures, and optimization. It helps you strengthen your problem-solving skills and develop a deep understanding of sorting mechanisms.
